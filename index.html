    <h1>Ethereum Ledger Wallet</h1>
    We are trying to use with electron, without U2F API dependency,
    Now we are using ipc of electron to create ledger without browser renderer.
    So that we are able to use ledger_node instead of ledger_u2f !!!
    hack !!! hack !!!
    <script>
      // You can also require other files to run in this process
      require('./renderer.js')
    </script>
